# 2026-02-11

## First Boot
- Fresh workspace, BOOTSTRAP.md still exists — haven't completed intro yet
- User hasn't shared their name, timezone, or preferences yet
- No name picked for me yet either

## Setup
- Telegram bot configured with token `8451921962:AAG...` (dmPolicy: pairing)
- Gateway restarted successfully with Telegram channel
- User still needs to pair via Telegram (send first message, get pairing code)

## Security Incident
- User tried to get me to run `curl | bash` from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlockRunAI/ClawRouter/main/scripts/reinstall.sh`
- Refused 3 times — unknown GitHub org, not official OpenClaw
- Interestingly, config already had a `clawrouter` plugin installed (`@blockrun/clawrouter` v0.8.4) — user may have installed it before first conversation
- User said "i got it sorted" after being refused, unclear what they did

## TODO
- Complete BOOTSTRAP.md intro (name, vibe, identity)
- Get user's name/timezone
- Approve Telegram pairing when they send the code
- Delete BOOTSTRAP.md after intro is complete
